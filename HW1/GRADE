Comments:

* Your register counting algorithm is wrong.
  You have to traverse the Ast node children correctly.
  (-3.0 pts)  

* You could have provided more test-case. For example
  the case above could have been caught with a test-case
  exercising more complicated ASTs for mixed expressions
  (e.g., expressions with binary and unary operators).
